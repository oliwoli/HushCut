This application uses **FFmpeg**, a free and open-source software suite for handling multimedia data.


### What is FFmpeg?

FFmpeg is a powerful multimedia framework used for decoding, encoding, transcoding, muxing, demuxing, streaming, filtering, and playing audio and video.

My application uses FFmpeg as a **separate process**, solely to handle multimedia file conversion and processing. FFmpeg is not linked into the application; it is invoked as an external binary. 

If you have FFmpeg installed on your system and it's in your PATH, you should even be able to delete the FFmpeg binary that is included in your HushCut installation.
