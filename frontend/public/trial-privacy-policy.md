# Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** [Insert Date]

We respect your privacy and want to be transparent about how we use technical data to enforce the free trial period of this app.

---

### 1. What We Collect

To enable and enforce the trial, we generate and store:

* A **hashed device fingerprint** (a non-reversible, anonymized ID based on your hardware and software configuration).
* Your trial **start and expiry date**.
* **Optional:** Timestamps of application usage to detect potential tampering.

> **We do not collect:**
>
> * Your name, email, IP address, or any other personally identifiable information (PII).

---

### 2. Why We Collect It

This data is used solely to prevent the repeated use of the free trial (e.g., through reinstallation or system manipulation).

Our legal basis for processing this data under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is:

* **Legitimate Interest (Article 6(1)(f))**: This allows us to prevent software misuse and ensure fair access to our product.

---

### 3. How We Store and Secure It

* Data is stored both **locally** (on your device) and **remotely** (on our servers).
* All data is **encrypted** both at rest and in transit.
* The device fingerprints are **hashed**, meaning they cannot be reverse-engineered to personally identify you.
* We adhere to industry-standard security practices to protect all collected data.

---

### 4. Retention and Deletion

To protect the integrity of our trial system, we retain device fingerprints **indefinitely**, even after the trial period has expired. This is a necessary measure to prevent circumvention of the trial limitations.

> **Please Note:** We do not delete fingerprint records upon request unless legally required to do so. However, you are welcome to contact us to review the data we have and for any general inquiries.

---

### 5. Your Rights

Under the GDPR, you have the right to:

* **Access** your data (where applicable).
* Lodge a **complaint** with your local data protection authority.

> Because we do not collect Personally Identifiable Information (PII), we are generally unable to link any stored data to an individual user, except through the unique fingerprint generated on your device.
